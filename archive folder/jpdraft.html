      Day 1 in Osaka
    </h2>
    <p>
      We arrived in Japan at around 10:30 AM. Once we checked into our hotel, it was already around 12PM. 
      We were very hungry so we explored the surrounding area. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to the trip, we made a list of possible restaurants in Osaka.
      <ul> 
        <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vs64myYCN8Hajzmb7">Mugen Ramen</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/785FJyVRbxhFSYtx9">Kushikatsu Tanaka America-mura</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uYyL4ofMK5BEEpgt9">Wagyu IDATEN</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FeJ2k5jCDdNEe42y5">Kadoya Shokudo</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yYZjY19w1GMCqjK2A">寿し炉端喜多郎寿し</a></li>
      </ul>
      However, all of these restaurants were too far and since we wanted ramen, we searched for some nice ramen spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually we settled for a a nice and nearby ramen restaurant called <strong><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DHQzSMwkCTdsEJv6A">Mugi X Tori</a></strong>.
    </p>

      The ramen was very delicious. The broth was Rich and creamy, unlike any other ramen I've ever had. 
      The flavour was <strong> strong </strong> and pronounced, and the meat was very tender and fatty.
